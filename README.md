## React Frontend Developer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Charterhouse/react-frontend-developer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Charterhouse/react-frontend-developer)

This is a monorepo for various resources and packages intended for use in React-based frontends.

It also serves as a live documentation. For instance, it demonstrates how to use [Confluenza](https://confluenza.now.sh) (based on Gatsby) to build a handy markdown documentation browser.
It also demonstrates how to configure the monorepo, and how to build an npm package supporting various 
module systems.

We would like React Frontend Developer to become a hub with handy resources about React: tutorials, videos, 
training, blogposts, etc, that together will form a learning path for every react frontend developer. 

We encourage you to browse our [documentation](https://react-frontend-developer.club/learning/react).

The React Frontend Developer website is deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and available at https://react-frontend-developer.club.
