## React Frontend Developer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Charterhouse/react-frontend-developer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Charterhouse/react-frontend-developer)

This is a monorepo for various resources and packages intended for use in React-based frontends.

It also serves a live documentation. Currently it demonstrates how to use Gatsby to build a handy markdown documentation browser and a small helper module for a more declarative css-grid in React.

Under the hood it shows how to configure the monorepo, and how to configure and an npm package supporting various module systems.

Finally, we want React Frontend Developer to become a hub with handy resources about React: tutorials, videos, training, blogposts, etc, that together will form a learning path for every react frontend developer. 

The React Frontend Developer website is deployed using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) and available at https://react-frontend-developer.club.
